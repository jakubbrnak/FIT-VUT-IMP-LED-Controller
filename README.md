#LED Controller

### Project Assignment and Overview

Our task was to connect and program a control system for a group of single-color 
LEDs and one RGB LED, allowing the user to set different animations and adjust their speed through a 
simple user interface.

### Technologies Used

The project was implemented using a combination of hardware and software technologies. The main hardware component 
is an ESP32 microcontroller with an integrated BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and Wi-Fi module. For wireless 
communication, BLE technology was used, which is characterized by low power consumption and fast data transmission.
For the actual setup and visual presentation, a group of single-color LEDs, one RGB LED, 330-ohm pre-soldered 
resistors, a breadboard, and jumper cables were used. The software part of the project was developed in 
the Arduino IDE, and the user interface is realized through a simple web page utilizing WebBluetooth technology.
